_This article introduces a summary chart for business process mapping. The chart shows both a brief and a full format for process mapping._

One of our readers asked us for a business process mapping chart, so here it is.

<div style = "text-align: center">
    <a href = "/files/process-map-poster.pdf"><img src = "/img/business-process-mapping.png" /></a><br/>
    <a href = "/files/process-map-poster.pdf">Download PDF</a>
</div>

The process map consists of two parts: 

* a chart showing business functions, business processes they include, and  
  possibly sub-processes of those business processes
* a list of business processes showing their sub-processes and their 
  dependencies.

The process map is typically created in either a brief or a full format.

The brief format includes a chart of business functions and processes followed by a list of subprocesses and their dependencies for each business process.

The full format process map adds more detail. The chart includes sub-processes in this case, and the business process list is expanded with detailed information about every sub-process:

*   business requirements
*   activities in sub-process
*   input data: source
*   input data: key attributes
*   business rules
*   data transformation (processing)
*   output data: destination
*   output data: key attributes
*   exceptions
*   user role
*   triggers
*   business process automation
