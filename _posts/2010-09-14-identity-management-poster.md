First of all, I'd like to say we're really grateful for all the feedback on our previous posters. Lots of people are still saying thank you for our [change management poster](http://blog.aoteastudios.com/2010/07/change-management-poster.html) published over two months ago, which is amazing!

One of our readers asked us whether we have a poster on identity management, and we thought it was a splendid idea so here it is:

<div style = "text-align: center">
    <a href = "/files/identity-management-poster.pdf"><img src = "/img/identity-management-poster-400.png" /></a><br/>
    <a href = "/files/identity-management-poster.pdf">Download PDF</a>
</div>

This poster is about the management side of things, so it doesn't cover the technical aspects.
