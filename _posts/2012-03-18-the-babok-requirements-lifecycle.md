_This instalment of the Beachcamp series is about the requirements lifecycle, and includes a visual map of the relevant section of the BABOK._

## Beachcamp: Day 8

Requirements are similar to our desires. Initially, it is just an idea to have something, then the desire moves into confirmation phase, then into justification and finally into the decision phase where we are ready to satisfy the desire in some way.

To shorten the learning curve, Iâ€™ve created a diagram illustrating the whole requirements lifecycle. I added checkpoints for tracking the progress within a project. Requirements statuses are allocated to knowledge areas for convenience.

The diagram can be used as a check list of being on the right track: understanding of business needs, vision of the desired business outcome, understanding of packaging requirements for effective communication, preparedness to formal reviews and readiness for the deployment of the solution.
