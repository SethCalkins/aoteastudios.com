_"Time flies. It's up to you to be the navigator."_ ~ Robert Orben

This quote is very applicable to our case. We launched our first
book, "Business Analysis Kickstart", back in 2010. But it seems
like it was yesterday.

A lot of water has gone under the bridge since then. The BA
industry has continued to develop. Agile has become a working
approach on many more projects. The IIBA gradually improved the
BABOK v2 to reflect these major changes to the BA industry,
resulting in the publication of the BABOK v3.

**I, too, decided to review what we've learned over these five
years.**

The main driver for our first book was to address the questions
of people who are either involved or are getting started in
business analysis. Business Analysis Kickstart explained the
approach, techniques and many tricks for you to to have up your
sleeve. *We used a highly visual way of delivering information to
save you time and effort required for getting new BA knowledge.*

Judging by my own experience across many projects, the profession
has a rather tall learning curve, even for experienced people,
not to mention those who are just starting out in the job. It
requires a lot of practice with approach and techniques. **You need
to learn many tricks to do the job effectively and build your
professional value.** This is just as true today as it was in
2010.

**As such, I believe that business analysts still need a resource
which provides practical, in-depth advice about business analysis
skills and techniques.**

I ended up doing a thorough review of BA Kickstart and
significantly expanding it based on my own experience and the
large amount of feedback and questions we received over the
years. As a result, I got four times as much material compared to
the original book, and the output of this process is the new
book, _"A Navigator Into Business Analysis"_.

**The new book builds on the solid foundation of the previous book**,
BA Kickstart, and provides both a broader and deeper coverage of
business analysis. Among many other things, it highlights many
aspects of functioning organisations that BAs need to be aware
of, and what factors business analysts must consider and base
their recommendations on for the final solutions (business and
information context, environment, stakeholders, infrastructure,
etc.).

I kept the same successful approach to presenting information
that our readers enjoyed. This approach:

* delivers a lot of information through quality visuals
* enables you learn at your own pace
* facilitates quick grasping of new complex knowledge
* saves you time on learning professional tricks
* delivers new effective skills
* gives you great insights into BA techniques
* delivers faster results that can be used in your job straight
away.

The book is split into three parts, and the current table of
contents for Part 1 looks like this:

Module 1: **Business Analysis Overview**

Module 2: **Business Analyst's Core Skills**

Module 3: **Business Analysis Lifecycle**

Module 4: **Business Analysis Techniques**

Module 5: **Business Analysis Techniques, Insights**

Module 6: **Business Analysis Templates**

I refined the BA Techniques chapter to reflect the changes made
to the **BABOK® v3**, and added insights into some of the most used
techniques.

I’m sure that Part 1 will serve well to those who are considering
business analysis as a potential profession, or those making
initial steps in a BA career.

The book is going through the final polishing stage, and it will
be available to you in a few weeks. Stay tuned to find out what
is in Part 2!
