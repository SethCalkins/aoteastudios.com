Over 2000 people downloaded our free business analysis framework poster, and we are really grateful for all the feedback and comments. We are glad that we could make a contribution to the BA community.

Our intention was to present the big picture of the business analysis domain, key phases of analysis, how it starts and where it ends, techniques applied across all phases and stakeholders involved.

We think that the most important part of the poster is the presentation of stakeholders right across all phases. They are the main source of knowledge for BAs in any project so planning and realisation of appropriate engagement and communication styles are the two pillars which support  BA's success.

We are working on some new areas associated with business analysis, and we're looking forward to discussion on these subjects.
