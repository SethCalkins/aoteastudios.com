I was talking to an architect about a holistic model of enterprise architecture which could facilitate the collaboration of BAs and architects. The architect referred me to TOGAF 9.0 (the latest architecture framework) where I could find the model. After spending some time on reading, I realized it does not contain the model I was interested in. TOGAF 9.0 contains high-level meta-models and their extensions. It is worth reading but it does not solve the raised problem.

An updated poster on Enterprise Architecture reflecting both views (BA and architect) was the result of my thinking about the model:

<div style = "text-align: center">
    <a href = "/files/enterprise-architecture-poster-2.pdf"><img src = "/img/enterprise-architecture-poster-2.png" /></a><br/>
    <a href = "/files/enterprise-architecture-poster-2.pdf">Download PDF</a>
</div>

I divided the whole enterprise architecture into layers to group the elements of the model. These elements can serve as checkpoints when you are working on a project to ensure that all pain points are addressed.

I would like to highlight the difference between the presented model and those in the TOGAF 9.0 with regard to business functions. In my opinion, a business function is a generic description of _what_ an enterprise does to accomplish its mission and survive in the external environment. A business process, in contrast, is a definition of _how_ these business functions are realized. In other words, business functions are static while business processes are dynamic and evolve over time.

The model illustrates the key elements within layers to guide communication with interested parties. I was using the model on my two recent projects where information about Services, Systems and Infrastructure was required to be gathered quickly. The model made the discovery process easier and guided documenting of the identified hardware and software assets. So it works in real life and helps a lot!
