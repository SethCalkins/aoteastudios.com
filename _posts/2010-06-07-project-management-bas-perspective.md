title: "Project management: BA’s perspective"
tags: ba pm

Having completed the _PRINCE2® Foundation Course_, I was inspired by the elegance of the methodology and process orchestration, and I thought, "Wouldn't it be great to show it from the BA's point of view?"Project managers and BAs work together closely, and I wanted to show that interaction throughout the main stages of a project. While I was at it, I decided I would also list all the documents written in the course of a project. I ended up with a poster that shows

*   stages and iterations in the project lifecycle
*   key documents produced by the project manager in the course of a project
*   BA knowledge areas used during each stage
*   which PM artifacts are used by BAs

Here it is:

<div style = "text-align: center">
    <a href = "/files/project-management-poster.pdf"><img src = "/img/project-management-poster.png" /></a><br/>
    <a href = "/files/project-management-poster.pdf">Download PDF</a>
</div>

I'd like to highlight two more points:

*   PM documents can be very helpful and make BA work more effective, as well as ensuring alignment of BA activities with the project approach
*   Both the PM and BA artifacts should go into the corporate repository at the end of the project to contribute to the knowledge base for future projects.
