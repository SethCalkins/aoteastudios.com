# Free Course: Get the Requirements Right

One of the significant changes in BABOK 3.0 is that it merges the Agile extension into the main body of BA methodologies. The idea is that a business analyst should draw on the techniques from different methodologies - both Agile and non-Agile. 

Thus, the core tools available to the business analyst for the purpose of defining requirements are Epic Stories, User Stories, Use Cases and Process Design. These tools are used at different stages of the project. 

This email course will guide you in using these techniques effectively. 

Over the next 7 days, you will learn about ways of capturing requirements using user stories, use cases, requirements types, templates to be used for documenting the captured requirements, and a way to handle process design.
