# It's hard to get stakeholders to do their part.

Some people don't see your value or see you as a distraction from their jobs. Others think your job is only to write their ideas down. Your PM makes unreasonable demands all the time. Executives don't seem to follow your presentations very well.

However, you need to find ways of working with all these people towards successful project completion. And do it while juggling projects and meeting deadlines of course. 

## What if you had better ways of dealing with stakeholders?

Imagine having effective techniques to engage people so that they actively contribute and work with you. Imagine being able to get the PM and executives on your side with ease. 

Imagine that business users were actually asking to work with _you_ and not other BAs because they see the value you bring.

## It's practical and convenient.

All the content is based on practical experience, battle tested and proven to produce results. 

You'll get all the materials at once, so you'll be able to study when it suits _your_ schedule. Possibly the hardest part of any course you take, even a highly practical one like this, is applying what you've learned. Because of this, <span style = "background-color: #fff77c">each of the modules includes assignments</span> to give you a springboard for putting things you've learned into use.

Once you start applying the course to your work, you might find that some things don't work quite as you expected, or you need clarification. That's why, as part of this course, you can <span style = "background-color: #fff77c">email me up to 10 questions</span> within a month of purchase, and I'll do my best to give you personalised advice for your situation. It's a great way to get answers about real life situations.
