## Why visual communication?

Let's face it, who wants to read long documents and then meticulously write down their feedback? People are busy with their jobs, and they want a quicker and easier way to communicate.

The approach you will learn is based in large part on the use of visual aids.

This is because visual communication provides <span style="background-color: #d5e6ff;">a lot of benefits for a BA</span>:
