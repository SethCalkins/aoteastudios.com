# Business Analysis Kickstart

Whether you are just starting out or already have years of experience in the business analysis field, completing BA tasks successfully project after project is a difficult job. 

*Am I following best practices? Have I covered everything to make this project a success? How can I avoid getting bogged down by my tasks?* I'm sure you've asked yourself dozens of questions like these. 

But with looming deadlines, legacy systems, undocumented processes, busy and distracted stakeholders, it's hard to find time to work on your skills. 

It's especially true when your options consist of long books with an academic bent, and expensive training courses.

## You have another option now...

Imagine if there was a guide to business analysis which was laser-focused on giving you <span style = "background-color: #fff77c">practical advice</span> and heaps of <span style = "background-color: #fff77c">visual summaries</span>, making it easy to understand and absorb complex concepts quickly.

## You can learn quickly with this guide. 

We have condensed a dozen books, countless articles and years of practical experience into just *95 concise pages* which will save you a lot of reading.

Kickstart is full of useful tips on communication with business users, obtaining information by observing users' activities, documenting the results of analysis, getting your point across with visual aids, and more.

> **I loved Kickstart for its concise visual breakdown of the typical BA processes. I am definitely a multi-channel, visual learner and can only consume so much BABOK text before the message gets lost.** <br/><br/> **Your diagrams really highlight the power of synthesizing information down into a visual model that represents multiple levels of information (system components, workflow, milestones, participants, context etc).** <br/><br/>- *Ed Garabedian, Business Analyst, Johnson & Wales University, USA*

## Comprehensive material.

We provide you with a **framework for business analysis and requirements management** and also show you the steps involved in each stage of business analysis:

<ul class = "check">
<li>enterprise analysis</li>
<li>BA planning and monitoring</li>
<li>requirements elicitation</li>
<li>requirements analysis</li>
<li>solution assessment and validation</li>
<li>requirements management and communication</li>
</ul>

We cover all the areas from the _BABOK_® Guide. The guide includes a reference of techniques used in each of these stages too.

In addition, we introduce the concept of <span style = "background-color: #fff77c">"business analysis critical path"</span> by analogy with project management, where we show what documents a BA uses and produces to make a project successful.

## More than just business analysis...

To be successful as a BA, you need to understand <span style = "background-color: #fff77c">more than just analysis</span>, and that's why we've also included sections on:

*   project management
*   stakeholder engagement
*   change management
*   risk management
*   issue management
*   business process modelling
*   ITIL
*   software development lifecycle
*   business rules
*   enterprise architecture

In these sections, we give you carefully extracted knowledge about all these areas which is relevant to business analysts. How many books would you have to read to find it all out yourself? We'd like to save you all that time and expense!
