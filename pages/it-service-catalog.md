A service catalog allows you to have a [highlight type = "one"]better understanding[/highlight] of the structure of the business and its processes. It allows you to [highlight type = "one"]see the impact of changes[/highlight] clearly. But how do you go about making it? These templates provide you with a structured way of cataloging your hardware, software, IT services and business services. They also come with suggested attributes to track, and you can add or remove attributes based on your needs.

Please consider the large number of [highlight type = "one"]benefits[/highlight] of having an IT service catalog:

[list style = "orb" color = "teal"]

*   **Unified terminology** used in communication between business user and IT personnel
*   Clear definition of **business criticality** of business services
*   **Clear visibility** of what business processes are supported by which services
*   **Effective service support** – the Service Desk can identify problem symptoms in a knowledge base for the affected business service
*   **Effective problem resolution** – the Service Desk initiates incident management activities in a more effective fashio
*   Problem management gets **more intelligent** through the use of the link between a service and a Configuration Item in a CMDB
*   Change management becomes **less risky** to the business as the impact of the proposed change can be assessed with the greater accuracy
*   **Monitoring of services** can be improved as different classes of IT services require different attention and thus utilization of tools
*   Reporting on service delivery and compliance with SLAs can be multi-dimensional. The IT organization can really start to evaluate its own performance and **demonstrate its contribution to the business**
*   Release management and transition into the production use **becomes more agile** and supports business objectives. Implementation of new services **runs smoothly** as the IT organization better understands its own operational environment
*   The link between business architecture and IT architecture **becomes transparent**.
[/list]

You could use a software application for your service catalog. However, most existing products on the market are either very expensive and complex, with a lot of effort required to get going, or not flexible enough. These templates will be suitable for [highlight type = "one"]small to medium size companies[/highlight] who have the need to track their IT related assets and business services.

The advantage of a spreadsheet based service catalog is that it's very easy to adjust what you keep track of. However, if your organization is large or very complex, then you should probably get a software package instead.

The service catalog template is provided in Microsoft Excel 2007 (.xlsx) as well as OpenOffice format. 

</p>We've also included a [highlight type = "one"]19 page guide[/highlight] which discusses the purpose and value of a service catalog. It also explains some of the attributes in the templates and shows example values. There is also a [highlight type = "one"]summary diagram[/highlight] which shows a summary view of the service catalog from both the IT and business points of view.

As an example, here is the list of attributes we suggest tracking for a server:
