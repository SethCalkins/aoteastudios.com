# Free Course: BABOK 3 Navigation Maps

This course will help you better understand the content of each Knowledge Area in the BABOK 3.0, as well as the activities you should undertake in the span of a project. I created visual Knowledge Area maps for BABOK 2.0 a few years ago, and many people found them very helpful in preparing for the CBAP exam and in understanding the BABOK generally. I have now updated the maps for BABOK 3.0, and put them together in this course.
